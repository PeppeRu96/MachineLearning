Training on partial train dataset and evaluating on the eval dataset for RBF SVM class-balancing with a prior (best model for the second target application)
Trying the best hyperparameters but class-balancing w.r.t target applications..
RBF SVM training on the train dataset and evaluating on the eval dataset with class-balancing for the target application with π=0.5 (gamma=1e+01) (C=1e-01 - K=1.0) - Preprocessing: [ Centering, Whitening_Within_Covariance, L2_Normalization ]
		min DCF (π=0.5) : 0.289
		min DCF (π=0.1) : 0.599
		min DCF (π=0.9) : 0.658
Target application (π=0.5) specific training cross-validation ended in 8 seconds
